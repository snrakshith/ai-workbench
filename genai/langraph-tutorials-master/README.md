# LangGraph Tutorial Series

A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial series teaching **LangGraph 1.1.9** from beginner to advanced level. This series is designed for Python developers who are new to AI agents and agentic frameworks.

## Overview

LangGraph is a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. This tutorial series will take you from basic graph construction to building production-ready, multi-agent systems.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this series, you will be able to:

- Build stateful workflows with LangGraph's StateGraph API
- Integrate OpenAI models with tool/function calling
- Implement conversation memory and persistence
- Create human-in-the-loop approval workflows
- Design multi-agent systems with parallel execution
- Apply production-ready patterns and optimizations
- Deploy LangGraph applications with confidence

## Tutorial Structure

The series consists of 10 progressive notebooks:

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Python 3.12+** installed
- **uv** package manager ([install instructions](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- Basic to intermediate Python programming skills
- Understanding of basic programming concepts (functions, classes, dictionaries)
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks

### Helpful (but not required)
- Basic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Experience with APIs
- Familiarity with async programming in Python

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download

Download this repository to your local machine.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, uv (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

# 1. Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# 2. Install all dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# 3. Configure API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# 4. Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your browser. Navigate to the first notebook to get started!

### 3. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Sign up or log in at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key (you won't be able to see it again!)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

## Cost Considerations

These tutorials use OpenAI's API, which is a paid service. Here's what to expect:

- **Most exercises**: Use GPT-3.5-turbo (very affordable, ~$0.002 per request)
- **Advanced examples**: Use GPT-4-turbo (more expensive, ~$0.01-0.03 per request)
- **Total estimated cost**: $2-5 to complete all notebooks

Tips to minimize costs:
- Start with GPT-3.5-turbo for practice
- Set usage limits in your OpenAI account
- Use smaller input/output token limits during testing

## Learning Path

### For Complete Beginners
Start with Notebook 01 and work through sequentially. Don't skip notebooks, as each builds on previous concepts.

### For Developers with LLM Experience
You can skim Notebooks 01-02 and start deeper engagement from Notebook 03 onwards.

### For Experienced AI Developers
Review Notebooks 01-04 quickly, then focus on Notebooks 05-07 for advanced patterns.

## Projects Included

- **Notebook 04**: Customer Support Bot with persistent memory
- **Notebook 05**: Research Assistant with human-in-the-loop
- **Notebook 06**: Multi-Agent Research System with parallel processing
- **Notebook 07**: Enterprise Customer Support System (capstone project)

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you encounter import errors:

```bash
# Ensure you're in the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

### API Key Issues

If you get authentication errors:

1. Check that your `.env` file exists and contains your API key
2. Ensure there are no quotes around the API key in `.env`
3. Restart your Jupyter kernel after changing `.env`

### Version Compatibility

If you encounter compatibility issues:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.12.x or later

# Check LangGraph version
uv pip show langgraph  # Should be 1.1.9 or later
```
